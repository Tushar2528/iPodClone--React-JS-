iPod Clone Web App:

Hosted Link - https://master--incandescent-sundae-5013b3.netlify.app/

This is a simple iPod clone built using fundamental concepts of React JS like class based components, conditional rendering, React states etc.

I had built this project when i initially started learning react JS and wanted to clear out my basics by doing a simple project.

The folder structure is as follows :

1- There is a src folder which contains all the component files along with all the style component files associated with the components.

2- there is a public folder which contains the audio and images folder again contains all the images/audio files used in the project.

To run this project on your local machine:

1- Clone this repository on your local machine.

2- Run "npm install" on your IDE terminal. (IDE could be of your choise. I used VS code to build this). This should install all the relevant dependencies in your local machine and create the node moduled folder.

3- Run "npm start" . This should start the devlopment server and then the page will load in your browser window.

Happy Learning !!
